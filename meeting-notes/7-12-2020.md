# Notes 

* Scala variances (subtyping relationships) [reading](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/variances.html).

* To maximize type inference for HOFs, group and order function arguments into multiple argument lists. Why would you do that? Type information flows from left to right across these argument groups and by currying arguments we aid in overcoming a restricton of the Scala compiler.

* A look into the Scala type [hierarchy](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/unified-types.html).

* Algebraic Data Types. The "algebra" comes from defined operators on a (or set of types) that act as laws governing their behaviour. A nice [overview](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/fp-book/algebraic-data-types-adts-in-scala/).

* There was a brief discussion on performance. [Benchmarking Scala Collections](https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BenchmarkingScalaCollections.html#memory-use-of-immutable-collections) may be an insightful read along with an independent look at [Scala Benchmarks](https://github.com/fosskers/scala-benchmarks).

* Implementing the respective foldRight and foldLeft operations in light of each other require some more clarificaton. This [SO discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17136794/foldleft-using-foldright-in-scala/17137030#17137030) might prove useful in demystifying it.

* In the next session, weâ€™ll revisit the chapter 3 exercises pertaining to folding operations and the remaining Tree exercises. Also, we'll read chapter 4 for the next session.

Action points:
- [ ] Lara to clone a repo in which we can apply our learnings based on the discussion with Yannis.
