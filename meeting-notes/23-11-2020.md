Notes:
- Why does functional programming make testing, reuse and parallelization easier:
    - It makes reuse easier because you don't have to take state into account when reusing something.
    - It makes testing easier because it forces you to write testable code.
    - It makes parallelization easier because there's no mutable state. 
    
- What are the downsides of functional programming:  
    - It's harder to debug.
    - It's more difficult to evaluate performance without any tools.
    - You miss the ease of short-circuiting that exceptions provide.
- Let's have an open IDE while going through exercises in case we want to test something.
- Let's discuss the downsides of functional programming once we finished the book.
- We'll read chapter 3 for next session.

Action Points:
- [ ] Is there compiler support for annotating non-pure functions? @borzoo
- [x] If we replace `bool && tailRecCall` with `bool & tailRecCall`, will it still be tail recursive? @eduard
  - `bool && tailRecCall` => `tailRecCall && bool` is no longer tailrecursive
  - `bool && tailRecCall` => `tailRecCall & bool` is no longer tailrecursive
- [ ] Move the repo to ecg github @borzoo
