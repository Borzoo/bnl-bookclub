Notes:
- 12 to 1 every other Monday
- We will read chapter 1 for 23/11 session
- We will solve the exercises and push the solutions to the repo before next meeting.
- Borzoo will be the minute taker for first 3 sessions, then we’ll decide if we need to take minutes at all.
- Deon and Borzoo will host the sessions but it would be great if others get involved too. We’ll rotate between volunteers.
- Don’t hesitate to join the meetings even if you haven’t read the material, the discussions may be beneficial either way.

Action Points:
- [x] Borzoo: Create recurring meetings
- [x] Borzoo: Create a repo on Github.com
